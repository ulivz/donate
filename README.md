# Donate

Hi there, I'm ULIVZ !

At present, I am an amateur open source enthusiast, who mainly focus on VuePress 1.x and its ecology. If I can get more support, I think I can spend more time on open source.

## Why Supporting Me? 

If you've ever visited the documentation website of the Vue.js projects, and if you've used VuePress to build your websites, blog or docs, there's a lot of my work behind it.

The goal of VuePress 1.x is more complex than we think (if you know that Gastby's team is a company), if I can accept a certain donations, then I will be able to care less about how I should live, but put more effort into taking care of the ecosystem of VuePress.

## Monthly support (Recommended)

2 years ago I started devoting my time to open-source for fun, but things have changed a lot over time. Now I have a day job and I can't spend that much time in open-source anymore. But here's a way to work around this, which is, becoming my patron to fulfill my dream of doing full-time open-source:
